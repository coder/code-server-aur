## Updating

Make sure you run these commands on an Arch machine. If you're a Coder employee, we suggest using your dogfooding environment.

1. Run `sh update.sh` and type in the new version
1. Push changes to GitHub: `git push`
1. Push changes to `aur`: `git push aur`
   - If you don't have this set up, run `git remote add aur ssh://aur@aur.archlinux.org/code-server.git`
   - Run `git push aur`

### SSH Key

In order to publish updates to AUR, you'll need to have an SSH key pair setup.

1. Create a config file file `~/.ssh/config`

```text
Host aur.archlinux.org
	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/aur
	User aur
```

2. Create a new key pair by running:

```shell
ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/aur
```

3. This will create a new public key at `.ssh/aur.pub`. Copy this and add to your AUR account under [My Account](https://aur.archlinux.org/account/yourusername/edit/) > SSH Public Key
4. You may also need to be added by the package maintainer (@coadler)

### New Maintainers

If a new maintainer joins the project, please add them to the top of `PKGBUILD`.

### Removing Old Maintainers

Instead of removing them completely, change their title from "Maintainer" to "Contributor".

### Automated publishing

@jsjoeio created an account under `cdrci` for automating publishing the AUR
package. If you need these credentials, please ask him.
